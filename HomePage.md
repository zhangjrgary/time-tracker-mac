Time Tracker is a small but very useful application for OS X written by Ivan Dramaliev ([original Time Tracker home page](http://www.slooz.com/trinkets.php?proj=timetracker)).

Aaron took over from there and added a bunch of features, made it universal binary etc.

From February 2010 I have taken over maintainership and try to add useful features as requested or needed by me. You can read more details about the project and its status on my blog http://rainer.4950.net/wordpress/?cat=4
