The current 1.3.x release of TimeTracker is stored here on google code in the SVN repository.

Aaron was at one time maintaining a seperate branch on github (git://github.com/avh4/time-tracker-for-mac.git).

While I will try to incorporate all of Aarons changes eventually (and the source structure), this can be currently regarded as discontinued.
